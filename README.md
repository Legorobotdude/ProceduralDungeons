# ProceduralDungeons
Scripts to procedurally generate dungeons in Unity3D

The sample scene includes everything you need to get started. DunGen.cs generates the layout of the dungeon and maze, and DunGenPlacer.cs places the actual tiles around the map. Both have several options exposed in the inspector.

Big thanks to Richard Hawkes for his videos on procedural generation, and Quaternius for his amazing free 3D assets.
